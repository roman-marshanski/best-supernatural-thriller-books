## What Qualifies as a Supernatural Thriller?

For the purposes of this list, a supernatural thriller is a book that combines:
- suspense or mystery-driven storytelling  
- elements beyond natural explanation (demons, curses, hidden forces, altered reality)  
- psychological or moral tension  
- consequences that escalate rather than reset  

These books are not simple fantasy adventures—they are built around uncertainty, threat, and discovery.
